# HighwayGUI
A Windows C# Application to learn windows forms, and OOP principles

This Windows C# application will bring up a parameter window to input 3 variables. The first parameter is the 
length of the highway simulation in miles. Second is the maximum number of vehicles to simulate at one time.
The final parameter is the total number of simulated ticks to demonstrate. After clicking on the Simulate
Highway button, another window comes up with buttons to add vehicles to the highway, and to start/stop the 
simulation. You can add a bicycle, motorbike, car, or semi-truck. They all travel at different speeds so
they exit the highway at different rates.

Upon exiting, the number of gallons of gas/bowls of Wheaties consumed is noted, calculated by using the
mpg variable.
